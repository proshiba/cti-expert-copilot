# Agent-Browser — Interactive Browser Collection & Evidence Capture

[`vercel-labs/agent-browser`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) is a fast
native-Rust browser-automation CLI built for AI agents. It is the skill's **primary
interactive collector** — the concrete tool behind the "agent-browser first" rule in
the Tool Priority cascade. It drives real Chrome via the DevTools Protocol and returns
**accessibility-tree snapshots** with compact `@eN` element refs (token-efficient for an
agent to read and act on), plus screenshots for evidence.

- **No API key** for core automation (only the optional `chat` natural-language mode needs
  a Vercel AI Gateway key). Apache-2.0, cross-platform (Win/macOS/Linux), MCP-capable.
- It ships its **own** agent skill + MCP server, so it works with **GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and Codex**.

> **OPSEC:** this opens target sites in a real Chrome. For scam/malware/darknet targets run
> it on a clean VPS/sandbox (see "Where to run it"), and use a proxy/VPN where appropriate.

## 1. Install (auto-install on first interactive need)

Pick whichever package manager exists (no API key required):

| OS | Install the CLI | Then download Chrome |
|----|-----------------|----------------------|
| Windows | `npm install -g agent-browser` (Node 24+) · or `cargo install agent-browser` · or `scoop install agent-browser` | `agent-browser install` |
| macOS | `brew install agent-browser` · or `npm i -g agent-browser` · or `cargo install agent-browser` | `agent-browser install` |
| Linux | `npm i -g agent-browser` · or `cargo install agent-browser` | `agent-browser install` |

`agent-browser install` fetches Chrome for Testing (first run only). The bundled
installers add this under `--headless`/`-Headless` (alongside Scrapling's browser).

## 2. Canonical command reference (load it, don't memorize it)

agent-browser serves its own **version-matched** guide — always prefer it over any
copy here:

```bash
agent-browser skills get core          # core workflow + exact command syntax
agent-browser skills get core --full   # extended reference
agent-browser skills list              # all skill packs
```

### Core workflow: open → snapshot → act → capture
```bash
agent-browser open https://example.com      # navigate
agent-browser snapshot                       # accessibility tree with @eN element refs
agent-browser read                           # extract page text/content
agent-browser click @e12                     # act on a referenced element
agent-browser fill @e5 "query text"          # fill an input (then click/submit)
agent-browser screenshot evidence.png        # capture visual evidence
agent-browser eval "document.title"          # run JS in page context
agent-browser mcp                            # expose as an MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC)
```
Snapshot first to get `@eN` refs, then click/fill by ref. Save screenshots to a file and
attach them to the report as evidence.

## 3. agent-browser vs Scrapling — complementary, not conflicting

They live in **different ecosystems** (agent-browser = Rust binary via npm/brew/cargo;
Scrapling = Python via pip) and each manages **its own** browser, so there is **no
dependency or runtime conflict** — only a little extra disk if both download a browser.
Use them at different layers:

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Interactive multi-step flows, logins, clicking, **screenshot evidence**, reading JS-rendered/SPA pages as an agent | **agent-browser** (primary) |
| Fast static fetch + HTML parsing (~2ms), bulk collection **inside Python scripts** | Scrapling `Fetcher` |
| Anti-bot / Cloudflare-protected pages | Scrapling `StealthyFetcher` |
| Headless JS render without agent interaction | Scrapling `DynamicFetcher` |
| Nothing above available | web search → web fetch → curl |

Rule of thumb: **agent-browser to *interact with and witness* a page; Scrapling to
*fetch and parse* pages programmatically.**

## 4. Where it's used (commands that benefit)

| Command / technique | How agent-browser helps |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `/case`, `/sweep` | Open + screenshot target sites; interactive recon; evidence for the report |
| `/scam-check` | Render a suspicious site, screenshot it, read content/redirects without trusting static HTML |
| `/visitors`, `/traffic`, `/techstack` | Read JS-heavy / login-walled analytics dashboards (SimilarWeb, etc.) |
| `social-media-platforms` | View profiles/posts that require JS or scroll; capture screenshots |
| `image-forensics-and-face-search` | Drive reverse-image / face-search upload flows (TinEye, FaceCheck, FotoForensics) and read results |
| `/gdoc`, `/sharelink` | Open share links, follow redirects, screenshot the landing/identity surface |
| `/stealer-log` follow-up | **Open the extracted admin/panel endpoints** (`admin.`, `kef.`, `ador.`…) to screenshot and confirm live actor infrastructure |
| `/report` | Embed captured screenshots as evidence exhibits |

Tag findings collected this way with `[browser]` (per the collection-method tags).

## 5. MCP mode (optional)

`agent-browser mcp` runs an MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC). In GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, or Codex you can
register it as an MCP server to expose browser actions as native tools, instead of (or in
addition to) shelling out to the CLI.
