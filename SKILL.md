# CTI Expert

Cyber threat intelligence and open-source intelligence skill. Turns an AI coding agent into a trained CTI/OSINT analyst. Generates precision search queries, interprets public data, builds case timelines, and delivers structured intelligence products — no API keys, no paid subscriptions.

> **Runs anywhere.** Works in **GitHub Copilot CLI**, **Claude Code** (Desktop & CLI), **OpenAI Codex / ChatGPT**, and other agent runtimes — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the cross-agent runtime contract. Copilot uses the custom agent in `.github/agents/` and the dispatcher in `.github/skills/cti-expert/`. Throughout this file, **`$SKILL_DIR`** = the directory containing this root `SKILL.md` (Copilot/Codex/manual clone: the repo; Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/cti-expert`). Resolve it by locating the root `SKILL.md` — never hard-assume a vendor-specific home directory. Detect the OS once (Windows/macOS/Linux) and prefer **uv** for all Python — see §13 Tool Auto-Install Policy.

Collection method: `agent-browser` when available (JavaScript-heavy sites, infinite-scroll, screenshot evidence), with automatic fallback to web search / web fetch / direct URL fetch. Tool limitations are logged as collection gaps — never as case blockers.

---

## 1. Quick Start

```bash
# Full autonomous case — runs every applicable technique
/case target.com

# Guided flow for first-time investigators
/flow person

# Summary of what's been found so far
/brief
```

Append `--yolo` to any command to skip all interactive prompts and confirmations. The analyst makes every decision autonomously.

---

## 2. AEAD Case Lifecycle

Every investigation follows four phases:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Acquire** | Collect raw data — `/sweep`, `/query`, `/username`, `/phone`, `/email-deep`, `/subdomain`, `/webpivot` + `/icp` (domain/URL targets), `/cn-corp` · `/iban` · `/hash-id` on discovery |
| **Enrich** | **Recursive pivot loop** — the [pivot orchestration engine](engine/pivot-orchestration.md) treats every discovered identifier as a new seed and expands the graph hop-by-hop (`/branch`, `/crossref`, `/link-subjects`, `/signatures`) **automatically until the frontier is exhausted**, no approval prompts (`autonomy=auto`). Acquire↔Enrich iterate, not run once. |
| **Assess** | Score and verify — `/exposure`, `/threat-model`, `/validate`, `/coverage`, `/verify-finding`. Judgments carry **likelihood terms**, coverage gets the **5W1H pass**, attributions get an **ACH matrix** ([`handbook/analytic-standards.md`](handbook/analytic-standards.md)) |
| **Deliver** | Package output — `/report`, `/brief`, `/render`, `/workspace save` — **auto-saves .md + .html + .json + .csv + IOC bundle** |

Run `/progress` at any point to see which phase you're in and what's pending.

> **`/case` and web-infra pivoting.** For a **domain or URL** target, `/case` includes
> web-infrastructure pivoting (`/webpivot`) in the Acquire phase. It runs **keyless by default**
> (crt.sh + passive DNS + anonymous urlscan) and **upgrades automatically when premium keys are
> set** via `/apikeys` (Shodan/Censys/FOFA/DNSLytics/SecurityTrails/urlscan-PRO/WhoisXML). Because
> `/webpivot` can fetch the target directly, for hostile infrastructure it prefers passive capture
> (urlscan/Wayback) — see [`techniques/web-pivot.md`](techniques/web-pivot.md). It is **not** run for
> username/phone/person targets.
>
> **Archive IOC harvest runs by default too.** For domain/URL targets the Acquire phase also runs
> `wayback_harvest.py <domain> --indicators` (add `--urlscan` when `URLSCAN_API_KEY` is set),
> harvesting **emails, phones, crypto wallets, tracking/verification IDs, SaaS-operator IDs, and
> socials from the *entire* Wayback history** — not just the live page — with first-seen/last-seen
> per selector. It writes case-schema `indicators[]` to `<case>/raw/harvest.indicators.json`, which
> merge into the case and flow into the **auto-saved IOC bundle** at Deliver. This is the step that
> recovers selectors a network later scrubbed — across the whole snapshot corpus, not just the live page.
> Passive by construction — only web.archive.org (+ urlscan.io if keyed), never the target.
>
> **The five v2.6 commands are in the pipeline too — no flags.** `/icp` runs for every
> domain/URL/org target (and an IP's resolved hostname); `/cn-corp`, `/iban` and `/hash-id`
> fire the moment a company name/USCC, payment detail, or hash appears — and all three feed
> their yields **back into the recursive pivot loop** as new seeds, so an ICP licence serial or
> a reused bank account expands the graph like any other node. `/redact` is the exception: it
> is **opt-in** (`--redact`), because a redacted report is a weaker artifact and that should
> always be a deliberate choice. Full trigger table: §Technique Activation Matrix.
> Narrow with `--no-cn`.

## 4. Subject & Connection Model

Reference: `engine/case-schema.json`, `engine/subject-registry.md`

### Subject Types

| Type | Emoji | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| Person | 👤 | Full name, alias |
| Username | @ | Social handle |
| Email | 📧 | Address, domain |
| Domain | 🌐 | Site, subdomain |
| IP Address | 🖥 | IPv4, IPv6 |
| Organization | 🏢 | Company, group |
| Phone | 📱 | E.164 format |
| Location | 📍 | GPS, address |
| Asset | 📦 | Document, image |
| Event | 📅 | Dated occurrence |
| Device | 🖥️ | IoT device, server, workstation |
| Image | 🖼️ | Photograph, screenshot |
| Crypto Address | 💰 | Bitcoin, Ethereum wallet |
| Bank Account | 🏦 | IBAN, local account no., BIC |
| ICP Filing | 📋 | PRC licence serial (one registrant, many sites) |
| Custom | 🏷️ | User-defined entity type |

### Connection Types

```
owns         — domain, email, or asset ownership
uses         — platform account or tool usage
works_at     — employment or affiliation
linked_to    — general association
alias        — same identity, different handle
communicated_with — observed contact
```

### Finding Trust Scores

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 5 | PRIMARY | Authoritative or official source |
| 4 | DERIVED | Confirmed by 2+ independent sources |
| 3 | CONFIRMED | Single reliable source, verified |
| 2 | ANECDOTAL | Reported but unverified |
| 1 | CONTESTED | Conflicting data exists |

### Source Reliability Scale

Complements numeric trust scores with source-level grading. Trust score rates finding content; source reliability rates the source itself.

| Grade | Label | Typical Sources |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| A | Completely Reliable | Official registries, government records |
| B | Usually Reliable | Established outlets, corporate sources |
| C | Fairly Reliable | Known blogs, industry publications |
| D | Not Usually Reliable | Anonymous forums, unverified claims |
| E | Unreliable | Known disinformation, fabricated content |
| F | Cannot Be Judged | Insufficient information to assess |

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Label | Use When |
|-------|-------|---------|
| VERIFIED | Direct observation, primary source | |
| STRONG | Multiple corroborating sources | |
| MODERATE | Single reliable source | |
| WEAK | Circumstantial or inferred | |
| TENTATIVE | Analyst deduction only | |
| CHALLENGED | Contradicted by other findings | |

### Likelihood Language (judgments, not findings)

The three scales above grade **evidence**. An analytic **judgment** built on that evidence —
an attribution, a motive, a forecast — carries a probability-anchored likelihood term instead.
Without an anchor, "MODERATE" routinely means a 30-point-different thing to writer and reader.

| Term | Band | | Term | Band |
|------|------|---|------|------|
| Almost no chance | 1–5% | | Likely / probable | 55–80% |
| Very unlikely | 5–20% | | Very likely | 80–95% |
| Unlikely | 20–45% | | Almost certain | 95–99% |
| Roughly even chance | 45–55% | | | |

**Likelihood and confidence are orthogonal — report both:**
> The operator is **very likely** based in Guangdong (**moderate confidence** — single
> registry record, unverified).

Never 0% or 100%. One term per judgment. Never attach a likelihood term to a directly
observed fact. `findings[].confidence` in the report JSON stays an integer describing
**evidence quality** — likelihood lives in the narrative.

**Attribution claims additionally require an ACH matrix** (competing hypotheses, scored by
inconsistency, runner-up named). Full rules — likelihood, the 5W1H coverage overlay, and ACH:
[`handbook/analytic-standards.md`](handbook/analytic-standards.md).

### Map Rendering (ASCII Mandatory)

**ALL visualization commands produce ASCII box-drawing art by default.** This includes `/graph`, `/render entities`, `/render network`, `/render timeline`, `/render risk`, `/pathfind`, and `/show-connections`. Mermaid available only with explicit `--mermaid` flag.

**Why ASCII-first:** Universal terminal compatibility, renders correctly in .md and .docx exports, no external renderer dependency.

## 5. Finding Framework

Reference: `engine/finding-framework.md`, `engine/conflict-resolver.md`

Every finding logged via `/record-finding` captures:

```
Source URL / method
Collection method (browser | search | fetch | manual)
Trust score (1–5)
Confidence level (VERIFIED → CHALLENGED)
Timestamp
Linked subjects
```

**Conflict detection** (`engine/conflict-resolver.md`): When two findings about the same subject contradict each other, the system flags a CONTESTED state. Both findings are preserved. Resolution options: accept one, mark both TENTATIVE, or log the conflict as its own finding.

**Deviation detection** (`analysis/deviation-detector.md`): Automatically flags behavioral anomalies — account creation gaps, platform presence inconsistencies, metadata mismatches.

**Weight engine** (`analysis/weight-engine.md`): Aggregates trust scores across findings to compute subject-level confidence.

## 8. Output Formats

Reference: `output/reports/`, `connectors/`

### Mandatory File Export (CRITICAL)

**Every `/report`, `/brief`, and `/case` command MUST auto-save the default export set to disk at the end of delivery:**

| # | Format | File | Role |
|---|--------|------|------|
| 1 | **Markdown** | `CTI-REPORT-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` | Diffable, greppable source of truth; also the input to the HTML/DOCX generators |
| 2 | **Interactive HTML** | `CTI-REPORT-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD].html` | **Primary human-facing deliverable** — self-contained, OFFLINE; charts + 2D entity graph + topology + timeline + indicator panel + search |
| 3 | **JSON** | `CTI-REPORT-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD].json` | Structured case data (the report JSON below); feeds the generators and downstream tooling |
| 4 | **CSV** | `CTI-REPORT-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD].csv` | Findings (and indicators, via the IOC export) for spreadsheets / SIEM lookups |
| 5 | **IOC / selector bundle** | `IOC-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD].{stix.json,txt,csv}` | Comprehensive indicators & selectors — STIX 2.1 + flat + CSV |
**Save location:** Current working directory, or `./osint-reports/` subdirectory if it exists.

**The default set is unredacted** — it is the analyst's working record. A shareable variant is
**opt-in**, never automatic, so nothing is ever quietly weakened. Request it with
`/redact` or `/case … --redact`:
```bash
S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts"; R="CTI-REPORT-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD]"
for f in md json csv; do
  uv run "$S/redact.py" "$R.$f" -o "$R.redacted.$f" --map "$R.map.json"
done
```
One `--map` across all three files keeps a selector's placeholder identical everywhere.
Infrastructure (URL/domain/IP) stays visible even then — in a CTI report the actor's
infrastructure is the analysis, not incidental PII; add `--all-types` to cover it too.
**Never ship the `.map.json`** — it reverses the redaction.

- **`--yolo`:** save the five-format default set with no prompt.
- **Interactive mode:** save the default set, then ask the user at the end whether they also want **DOCX** (Word) or **PDF**.
- **DOCX is NOT in the default set** (heaviest, most failure-prone toolchain). Generate it on request (`/report docx`) or automatically for `/report legal` (evidentiary, where a fixed Word/PDF artifact is expected). HTML **"Print → Save as PDF"** covers most PDF needs for free.
- Explicit machine-format subcommands always emit that format directly: `/report json`, `/report csv`, `/report ioc`.

**The HTML, JSON, CSV and IOC outputs all derive from one `report JSON`.** Build it once, then run the generators below.

**Step 1 — Build the report JSON file.** The generators expect a SPECIFIC flat format (NOT the engine case-schema.json). You MUST construct the JSON matching this exact structure before calling the scripts. Reference: `scripts/sample-cti-report-data.json`.

```json
{
  "case": {
    "id": "CTI-2026-001",          // string, case identifier
    "label": "Case Title",         // string, human-readable name

  },
  "executive_summary": "Full paragraph summarizing investigation findings...",
  "subjects": [
    {
      "id": "SUB-001",            // string ID (not UUID)
      "label": "target.com",      // human-readable name — REQUIRED for display
      "type": "domain",           // lowercase: domain, person, ip, organization, email, username
      "confidence": 95,           // INTEGER 0-100 (not string like "VERIFIED")
      "verified": true,           // boolean

      "first_seen": "2025-01-15", // ISO date string
      "notes": "Primary domain"   // string
    }
  ],
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "FND-001",            // string ID
      "subject_id": "SUB-001",    // links to subject
      "type": "infrastructure",   // credential, infrastructure, identity, exposure, behavioral, legal
      "weight": "HIGH",           // CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO — drives severity colors
      "description": "Full description of the finding...",
      "source_url": "https://...",
      "collected_at": "2026-04-08T10:00:00Z",
      "confidence": 88,           // INTEGER 0-100 (not string)
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "id": "CON-001",
      "from_id": "SUB-001",       // subject ID
      "to_id": "SUB-002",         // subject ID
      "relationship": "owns",     // string describing relationship
      "strength": "confirmed"     // confirmed, probable, possible
    }
  ],
  "timeline": [
    {"date": "2025-01-15", "event": "Domain registered"}
  ],
  "sources": [
    {"name": "Source Name", "url": "https://...", "date": "2026-04-08"}
  ],
  "intelligence_gaps": [
    "Gap description string"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Action item string"
  ],
  "visitor_stats": {              // optional — enables visitor intelligence charts
    "domain": "target.com",
    "monthly_visits": 150000,
    "traffic_sources": {"direct": 42, "search": 28, "referral": 15, "social": 10, "paid": 5},
    "top_countries": [{"country": "Vietnam", "share": 60}, {"country": "US", "share": 20}]
  },
  "caveats": ["Caveat string"]   // optional — overrides default methodology notes
}
```

**CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:**
- `confidence` on subjects and findings MUST be an **integer** (e.g., `85`), NOT a string (e.g., `"VERIFIED"`)
- `findings` MUST be a **flat top-level array**, NOT nested inside subjects
- `label` is REQUIRED on each subject (this is what displays in the report — not `value` or `display_name`)
- `weight` on findings drives severity coloring — use CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/INFO
- `recommendations` must be an array of **strings** (not objects with `priority`/`action` keys)
- All fields shown above should be **populated with actual data** — empty strings or "N/A" defeat the purpose
- Populate `executive_summary` with a full paragraph — this is the most-read section of the report

**Optional enrichment fields (backward-compatible — used by the HTML report & IOC export when present):**
- `subjects[].role` — `actor` | `victim` | `infrastructure` | `associate` | `witness` (drives the role chips and actor↔victim attribution; otherwise inferred from type/links)
- `subjects[].selectors[]` — contact/social points attached to a person/org: `{type, value, platform, url}` (e.g. a victim's phone, an actor's Telegram or LinkedIn) — surfaced in the Indicators panel and IOC export
- `indicators[]` — analyst-curated indicators to force into the export verbatim: `{type, value, category, role, confidence, source_url}`

**Step 2 — Generate the interactive HTML report (PRIMARY human-facing deliverable).** Self-contained, OFFLINE, zero toolchain to view — opens in any browser:
```bash
S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts"     # $SKILL_DIR = dir containing SKILL.md
uv run "$S/generate-cti-html.py" "REPORT.json" "REPORT.html"   # any OS, zero setup
# no uv installed: python3 "$S/generate-cti-html.py" "REPORT.json" "REPORT.html"   (Windows: py …)
```
It injects the report JSON into `cti-report-template.html` and renders, entirely client-side and offline (no CDN, no network calls): KPI cards, an exposure gauge, a finding-type pie, severity bars, a draggable/zoomable **2D entity graph**, **infrastructure topology**, an **event timeline**, and the **comprehensive Indicators & Selectors panel** (network IOCs + contacts + identities + social/messaging handles + wallets + actor↔victim attribution) — with global search, category menus, dark/light themes and a print-to-PDF stylesheet.

**Step 3 — Generate the comprehensive IOC / selector bundle.**
```bash
uv run "$S/generate-cti-iocs.py" "REPORT.json" "IOC-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD]" --format all
# single format: --format stix | flat | csv
```
Extracts EVERY indicator that profiles or can reach an actor/victim — network IOCs, emails/phones, usernames/names/aliases, social-media profiles, messaging handles, crypto wallets, and the attribution links between subjects. Full spec: [`techniques/ioc-export.md`](techniques/ioc-export.md).

**Step 4 — DOCX (on request, or automatically for `/report legal`).** Word is no longer auto-generated by default. When the user asks for it (or for evidentiary reports), build it from the SAME report JSON + MD. The generators carry **PEP 723 inline dependency metadata**, so the simplest, most portable runner is **`uv run`** — it provisions the deps on the fly with zero venv/pip setup, identically on every OS. The generator is also **self-healing**: it forces UTF-8 output and auto-locates pandoc (including Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pandoc`), so **no `PYTHONUTF8` / PATH prelude is needed**. Replace `REPORT` with `CTI-REPORT-[CASE-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD]`.

**Preferred — `uv run` (any OS, any agent, zero setup):**
```bash
S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts"     # $SKILL_DIR = dir containing the root SKILL.md (Copilot/Codex: repo; Claude Code: ~/.claude/skills/cti-expert)
# Primary: HYBRID — full narrative from MD + charts/diagrams from JSON (zero content loss)
uv run "$S/generate-cti-docx-hybrid.py" "REPORT.md" "REPORT.json" "REPORT.docx"
# Fallback 1: JSON-only (charts + structured data; no pandoc needed)
uv run "$S/generate-cti-docx.py" "REPORT.json" "REPORT.docx"
# Fallback 2: MD-only (styled narrative, no charts)
uv run "$S/generate-cti-docx-hybrid.py" "REPORT.md" "REPORT.docx"
```
> Windows PowerShell: set `$S = Join-Path $SKILL_DIR "scripts"`; use the open repository for Copilot/Codex or the installed skill directory for Claude Code.

**Fallback — no uv installed.** Use the OS interpreter; the script's `ensure_deps()` installs the libs on first run (via uv if present, else pip):
- macOS / Linux (Bash): `python3 "$S/generate-cti-docx-hybrid.py" "REPORT.md" "REPORT.json" "REPORT.docx"`
- Windows (PowerShell): `py "$S\generate-cti-docx-hybrid.py" "REPORT.md" "REPORT.json" "REPORT.docx"` — the Store `python3` stub will not run; use `py` or the venv python
- Last resort (no styling/charts): `pandoc "REPORT.md" -o "REPORT.docx" --from markdown --to docx --standalone`

**How the hybrid generator works:**
1. **Phase 1:** pandoc converts the MD file to a base DOCX (preserving ALL narrative content — tables, lists, formatting)
2. **Phase 2:** python-docx post-processes to add CTI professional styling, prepend cover page + TOC, and inject charts/diagrams from JSON at matching section headings

**The MD file is the primary content source.** It carries the full narrative (detailed person profiles, infrastructure tables, wallet addresses, corporate structure, legal history, etc.). The JSON file provides structured data for visual elements (charts, diagrams, risk gauge). Using both together produces a complete report with zero content loss.

**Rich hybrid DOCX includes:** Cover page titled "CTI REPORT", table of contents, **all narrative content from MD** (every paragraph, table, list, code block), pie chart (finding types), bar chart (severity), risk gauge (exposure score), timeline chart, entity relationship diagram, network topology diagram, traffic/geo charts, CTI-themed styling (navy headings, styled tables), header/footer with classification and page numbers.

**After saving, confirm all files to the user:**
```
📄 Report saved (default export set):
   → CTI-REPORT-CASE001-2026-03-30.md
   → CTI-REPORT-CASE001-2026-03-30.html   (interactive — open in any browser, fully offline)
   → CTI-REPORT-CASE001-2026-03-30.json
   → CTI-REPORT-CASE001-2026-03-30.csv
   → IOC-CASE001-2026-03-30.stix.json / .txt / .csv   (indicators & selectors)

   Need a Word (.docx) or PDF too? (PDF = open the .html and Print → Save as PDF)
```

### Report Formats

| Format | Command | Audience |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Interactive HTML | `/report` (default) · `/report html` | Everyone — analysts to execs; the primary deliverable |
| Technical INTSUM | `/report` | Analysts, security teams |
| Executive Brief | `/report brief` | Decision-makers, management |
| Plain-Language Summary | `/brief` | Non-technical stakeholders |
| Legal Evidence Format | `/report legal` | Attorneys, compliance teams (auto-adds DOCX/PDF) |
| Journalist Format | `/report journalist` | Reporters, media |
| JSON Export | `/report json` | Downstream tools, pipelines |
| CSV Export | `/report csv` | Spreadsheets, databases |
| IOC / selector bundle | `/report ioc` | SIEM/TIP ingest, threat-intel sharing |
| Word document | `/report docx` | Formal sharing (on request) |

Every narrative report auto-saves the **default export set** (.md + .html + .json + .csv + IOC bundle — see Mandatory File Export above). `/report legal` additionally produces DOCX/PDF. Machine-only subcommands (`json`, `csv`, `ioc`) emit their native format directly.

### Visual Outputs

| Type | Command | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| Subject relationship map | `/render entities` | **ASCII** (default) — `--mermaid` for Mermaid |
| Chronological timeline | `/render timeline` | **ASCII** Gantt |
| Exposure heatmap | `/render risk` | **ASCII** |
| Network topology | `/render network` | **ASCII** |

**All visual outputs use ASCII box-drawing by default.** Mermaid only on explicit `--mermaid` flag.

**Diagram tradecraft:** [`output/visuals/diagram-patterns.md`](output/visuals/diagram-patterns.md) — compile-check a Mermaid diagram before presenting it, and pick the right diagram type per CTI question (attack → sequence, lifecycle → state, handoffs → swimlane, infra → graph).

The **interactive HTML report** (default deliverable) renders all of these as live, explorable visuals — a draggable/zoomable 2D force-directed entity graph, infrastructure topology, an event timeline, and SVG charts (pie/bar/gauge/donut) — alongside the ASCII versions in the `.md`.

### Connectors

| Tool | File | What It Exports |
|------|------|----------------|
| Maltego | `connectors/maltego-export.md` | GraphML entity graph |
| Obsidian | `connectors/obsidian-setup.md` | Linked markdown notes |
| Notion | `connectors/notion-schema.md` | Structured database |

---

## 9. Skill Tiers & Customization

Reference: `experience/skill-tiers.md`, `experience/layered-detail.md`

### Tiers

| Tier | Command | What Changes |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Novice** | `/novice` | Jargon removed, steps explained, glossary auto-linked |
| **Practitioner** | (default) | Standard output, moderate detail |
| **Specialist** | `/novice off` | Full technical detail, raw findings, internal signals |

Switch tiers at any point — output adapts immediately.

### Guided Flows

`experience/guided-flows/` contains step-by-step interactive flows:

- `person-investigation.md` — Full guided person case
- `domain-reconnaissance.md` — Guided domain sweep
- `email-investigation.md` — Guided email tracing
- `rapid-case.md` — 10-minute abbreviated sweep

Activate: `/flow person` · `/flow domain` · `/flow email` · `/flow quick`

### Case Templates

`experience/case-templates/` contains pre-built starting configurations:

- `due-diligence.md` — Corporate partner vetting
- `security-audit.md` — Organization exposure audit
- `background-check.md` — Individual background research

Activate: `/template run [name]`

## 10. Ethics & Boundaries

This skill operates strictly within publicly available information.

### Permitted

- Journalists verifying facts about public figures or institutions
- Security professionals auditing their own organization's exposure
- Individuals reviewing their own digital footprint
- Corporate due diligence on business partners
- Academic research and educational demonstrations

### Prohibited

- Stalking, harassment, or doxing of any individual
- Accessing accounts or systems without authorization
- Social engineering or deception campaigns
- Any activity violating applicable law

Ethical reminders are issued automatically when the investigation approaches sensitive territory. Public data is not a license to cause harm.

---

## 11. Autonomous Mode (--yolo)

Append `--yolo` to any command or activate at session start.

**What changes:**
- No clarifying questions — analyst infers context and proceeds
- No confirmation prompts — scope expands automatically on new discoveries
- Guided flows skip Q&A — reasonable defaults applied
- Both `/report` and `/brief` generated without asking

**What stays the same:**
- Ethics and legal boundaries — always enforced
- Trust scores on every finding
- Source citations on every claim
- `/validate` and `/coverage` run before final delivery

Activate per-command: `/case target.com --yolo`
Activate for session: `/cti-expert --yolo`

### The five v2.6 commands in `/case`

Four fire automatically as part of the standard pipeline — no flag needed. `/redact` is
opt-in.

| Command | Fires | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| **`/icp`** | **Unconditionally** for every domain/URL/org target, and on an IP target's resolved hostname. One cheap passive lookup — and a *missing* filing on CN-hosted infrastructure is itself a finding, so there is no CN-nexus precondition. A discovered **licence serial** re-enters the pivot loop as its own node and reverse-searches to sibling domains (same operator, HIGH). | Acquire |
| **`/cn-corp`** | Automatically on any company name or USCC the case surfaces — from the ICP filing, WHOIS registrant org, page footer, or personnel discovery. Runs the GSXT → aggregator → 信用中国 chain; officers/shareholders/subsidiaries re-enter the loop as new nodes. | Acquire → Enrich |
| **`/iban`** | Automatically on any payment detail that surfaces — page DOM, Wayback harvest, victim statement, invoice, stealer log. Validation is arithmetic on a string, so it is free and touches nothing. Valid accounts become `financial/iban` IOCs; a checksum-**invalid** account on a payment page is logged as a behavioural finding instead. | Acquire → Enrich |
| **`/hash-id`** | Automatically on **every** discovered hash, and always **before** `/hash`. Decides file hash (→ MalwareBazaar/VT) vs credential material (→ `/breach-deep`, never a public service). 64-hex is queued for both the cert-fingerprint and file-hash readings, since it is genuinely ambiguous. | Acquire → Enrich |
| **`/redact`** | **Opt-in, not automatic** — pass `--redact` (or run `/redact` later). Emits `REPORT.redacted.{md,json,csv}` + `REPORT.map.json` alongside the unredacted set. A redacted report is a *weaker* artifact, so producing one stays a deliberate choice. | Deliver |

Registries needing mainland egress (TianYanCha/QCC/Aiqicha) are logged as **collection gaps**,
never blockers ([`techniques/china-recon.md`](techniques/china-recon.md) §7). Non-IBAN rails
(VN transfer, VietQR/NAPAS BIN, card BIN, e-wallet) follow
[`techniques/fiat-payment-osint.md`](techniques/fiat-payment-osint.md) §4.

**Flags:** `--no-cn` skips `/icp`+`/cn-corp` (both run by default). `--redact` *adds* the
redacted variant (off by default).

**Recursive pivot orchestration (the spider-map).** `/case` is not a one-pass collector —
it runs a **recursive BFS pivot engine**: every discovered identifier becomes a new seed,
and the relationship graph expands **hop by hop until the frontier is exhausted** or a
budget cap is hit. The state machine — identifier typing, dedup / cycle prevention,
per-node depth, the identifier→pivot **edge matrix**, confidence gating, and per-depth
checkpoints — is [`scripts/pivot_orchestrator.py`](scripts/pivot_orchestrator.py); the full
spec is [`engine/pivot-orchestration.md`](engine/pivot-orchestration.md). The orchestrator
**plans and tracks**; the agent **executes** each hop's technique commands and feeds results
back via `--ingest`.

- **Defaults:** `posture=active` (may fetch/scan targets; still passive-first for hostile
  infra), `reach=exhaustive` (pivot till the frontier empties), **`autonomy=auto`** — the loop
  **runs to closure unattended**, no per-depth approval prompts. Depth summaries are still
  printed as they happen, so the expansion stays auditable. Safety caps: `max_nodes=500`,
  `max_depth=6`.
- **Gating** (reuses [`analysis/auto-branch-rules.md`](analysis/auto-branch-rules.md)):
  exact-match links (≥95% — shared GA ID / cert / favicon / registrant email, handle
  exact-match) **auto-pursue unbounded**; HIGH/MEDIUM capped per type; LOW held unless
  corroborated; PII (`person`/`phone`) **auto-expands by default** (hold with `--authorization unconfirmed`); visited
  nodes and past-depth-cap nodes suppressed (loop-safe).
- **Example hops:** an **email** auto-pivots via reverse-WHOIS→domains, `/breach-deep`,
  `/github-osint`; a **domain** discovered from a person (high-confidence link) continues
  via `/webpivot`+`wayback_harvest`+`whois_enrich`+`cert_pivot`+subdomains; a shared **GA ID**
  reverse-pivots to sibling domains — each new node re-enters the loop.
- **Control flags** (all *narrowing* — the defaults are already maximal):
  `/case <t> --passive|--passive-first`, `--reach balanced|focused`,
  **`--checkpoint`** (pause for approval after each depth level), `--depth N`, `--budget N`,
  `--authorization unconfirmed` (re-hold PII), `--no-cn`; `--redact` opts *in* to the redacted variant.
- **Termination** → emit edges → `graph_build.py` → interactive HTML force-graph + topology
  + timeline; findings/indicators roll into the auto-saved report + IOC bundle.

Legacy one-hop note (still true, now a subset of the loop): if `/sweep` on a domain finds an
email, `/email-deep` and `/breach-deep` trigger on it automatically.

**GitHub OSINT auto-fire in `/case`:**
- Domain/Org target → run `/github-osint` on the org name, primary domain, discovered GitHub orgs/repos, and developer-platform hits from `/query` or `/dork-sweep`.
- Username target → run `/github-osint` directly when the handle has a GitHub profile or GitHub search hit.
- Person target → run `/github-osint` only after discovering a likely GitHub handle, commit email, repo author, or developer profile link.
- Email target → run `/github-osint` only after discovering commit attribution, GitHub noreply patterns, profile links, or repo references.
- Results feed into `/secrets`, `/branch`, `/timeline`, `/crossref`, `/exposure`, and final `/report` automatically.

<!-- dork-integration:phase-05 start -->
**`✅*` dork coverage notes:** `/dork-sweep` on IP runs against reverse-DNS hostname once resolved (graceful skip if no rDNS); `/docleak` on Username targets document-author/uploader fields on scribd, slideshare, academia.edu, researchgate.

**Dork auto-fire matrix — every `/case` target type gains coverage:**
- Person → `/dork-sweep --telegram --docs` + `/docleak` on full name
- Domain → `/dork-sweep --filetype --docs` + `/docleak` on domain + org name
- Org → `/dork-sweep --filetype --docs --telegram` + `/docleak` on org + primary domain
- Username → `/dork-sweep --telegram --docs` + `/docleak` (author-angle)
- Email → `/dork-sweep --telegram --docs` on email + `@domain`
- IP → `/dork-sweep` on rDNS-resolved hostname (skipped if no rDNS)

Adaptive fan-out: discovered emails → Telegram dork; discovered personnel → `/docleak`; discovered subdomains → filetype dork; discovered usernames → Telegram + doc sweep; discovered IPs → rDNS → dork-sweep.
<!-- dork-integration:phase-05 end -->

When `/case` or `/sweep` runs on a Domain or Org target, it inspects the MX record and SPF TXT record. If MX ends in `protection.outlook.com` OR SPF contains `spf.protection.outlook.com`, `/msftrecon` auto-fires as part of the Acquire phase. Results feed back into the subject registry as `infrastructure` findings (tenant ID, federation type, MDI presence) and into `/exposure` scoring.

**`/case` pipeline walkthrough (M365-hosted Domain/Org):** (a) standard DNS/WHOIS/subdomain/traffic/scam-check/breach-deep checks run first, (b) if M365 indicators present → `/msftrecon` fires automatically with no extra flag, (c) tenant ID discovered becomes a pivot for `/branch` in Enrich phase (search other domains under the same tenant). No user intervention required.

**Parallel enrichment (3+ subjects):** When Acquire discovers 3+ subjects, enrichment commands fan out in parallel via AgentFlow DAG orchestration. Each subject's enrichment runs independently, results merge with dedup before Assess phase. Disable with `--sequential` flag. See `techniques/agentflow-enrichment.md`.

## Exposure Score Bands

| Range | Label | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0–25 | Minimal | Passive monitoring sufficient |
| 26–50 | Moderate | Periodic review advised |
| 51–75 | Elevated | Address within 30 days |
| 76–100 | Critical | Immediate escalation required |

## Tool Priority & Fallback

**Primary interactive collector: [`agent-browser`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser)** (vercel-labs) — a fast native-Rust CDP browser that returns accessibility-tree snapshots (`@eN` element refs) + screenshots; **no API key** for core automation; cross-platform; also an MCP server. Full how-to + per-command usage in [`techniques/agent-browser.md`](techniques/agent-browser.md). It is **complementary to Scrapling, not in conflict** (different ecosystems — Rust binary via npm/brew/cargo vs Python via pip — each manages its own browser): use **agent-browser to *interact with and witness* a page** (logins, clicks, screenshots, JS render) and **Scrapling to *fetch and parse* pages programmatically**.

1. Check `agent-browser` first (`agent-browser --version`; load its guide via `agent-browser skills get core`; install per the auto-install policy if missing)
2. Use `agent-browser` for: screenshot evidence, logins/interactive UI, JS-rendered/SPA pages, complex multi-step browser flows
3. Use Scrapling DynamicFetcher for: JS-heavy sites, SPA content, auto-escalation from static (programmatic)
4. Use Scrapling StealthyFetcher for: anti-bot bypass, Cloudflare-protected targets
5. Use Scrapling Fetcher for: fast static page collection, HTML parsing (~2ms)
6. Fall back to web search → web fetch → direct curl — no investigation blockers
7. Tag each finding with collection method: `[browser]` · `[scrapling-dynamic]` · `[scrapling-stealth]` · `[scrapling-static]` · `[search]` · `[fetch]` · `[manual]` · `[whois-lib]` · `[whois-cli]` · `[whois-api]`

## Tool Auto-Install Policy

**Before running any CLI tool, detect the OS, check whether the tool exists, and if not, install it automatically and silently using the method correct for that OS.** This ensures zero-friction investigation on Windows, macOS, and Linux alike — the analyst never stalls on a missing dependency and never runs a Linux-only command on Windows.

> **Full cross-platform reference:** [`scripts/platform-setup.md`](scripts/platform-setup.md) — OS detection, `$PY`/shell conventions, package managers, the complete per-tool × per-OS install matrix, and known gotchas. Consult it whenever this summary is not enough.

### Step 0 — Detect the platform (once per session)

Determine the OS before running anything, and cache it for the rest of the session. Use runtime-provided platform metadata when available; otherwise probe with PowerShell `$IsWindows`/`$IsMacOS`, or Bash `uname -s` (`Darwin`=macOS, `Linux`=Linux, `MINGW*`/`MSYS*`/`CYGWIN*`=Windows/Git Bash). Then fix these conventions:

| | Windows | macOS / Linux |
|--|---------|---------------|
| **Shell** | PowerShell | Bash |
| **Python runner** (`$PY`) | **`uv run`** (preferred) · else venv `…\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` · else **`py`** | **`uv run`** (preferred) · else venv `…/.venv/bin/python3` · else **`python3`** |
| **"exists?" check** | `Get-Command <tool> -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` (or `where.exe <tool>`) | `command -v <tool>` |
| **System pkg manager** | `winget` (→ `choco`/`scoop`) | `brew` (macOS) · `sudo apt`/`dnf`/`pacman` (Linux) |

> On Windows, `python3`/`python` in the Bash tool is often a non-functional Microsoft Store stub. Prefer **uv** (it brings its own Python and sidesteps the stub); otherwise use `py` via PowerShell.

### Step 0.5 — Ensure uv (the primary Python toolchain)

**[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the preferred way to install and run everything Python in this skill.** It is a single fast, cross-platform tool that replaces `pip`, `pipx`, `venv`, and `pyenv`, manages its own Python (so the Windows Store-stub problem disappears), and resolves script dependencies on the fly. Using uv also **collapses the per-OS split for Python tools** — the same command works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Check:** `uv --version`
- **Install if missing:**
  - Windows: `winget install --id astral-sh.uv` — or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
  - macOS / Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` — or `brew install uv`
  - Any OS that already has pip: `python -m pip install uv`

If uv genuinely cannot be installed, fall back to the per-OS `pip`/`pipx`/`venv` path — nothing here hard-requires uv.

### Auto-Install Protocol

1. **Check:** OS-correct existence test from the table above (or `<$PY> -c "import <module>"` for Python modules)
2. **Install:** If missing, run the OS-correct install command (see dispatch below / `platform-setup.md`)
3. **Verify:** Confirm the tool resolves before proceeding — re-check; on Windows a fresh install may need a new shell or a probe of its install dir
4. **Log:** Note `[auto-installed]` in the finding's collection method tag
5. **Continue:** Proceed with the investigation — never block on tool availability

### Install Dispatch by Category

**Python tools — uv, identical on every OS** (the big win: no per-OS split). CLIs use `uv tool`; libraries go into the skill venv via `uv pip`. No-uv fallback in the last column.

| Python tool(s) | Install (any OS, uv) | No-uv fallback |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| CLIs — maigret, sherlock-project, holehe, h8mail, waymore, xeuledoc | `uv tool install <pkg>` | `pipx install <pkg>` |
| Libraries — cloudscraper, oletools, whoisdomain, scrapling | `uv pip install --python <venv> <pkg>` | `<$PY> -m pip install <pkg>` |
| Scrapling headless | `uv tool install "scrapling[fetchers]"` then `scrapling install` | `<$PY> -m pip install "scrapling[fetchers]"` then `scrapling install` |
| AgentFlow | `uv pip install --python <venv> --no-deps agentflow` | `<$PY> -m pip install --no-deps agentflow` |
| Git-only — theHarvester, msftrecon, blackbird, sharetrace | `uv tool install "git+https://…/theHarvester.git"` · `uv pip install "git+https://…/msftrecon.git"` · clone + `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` | `pipx install "git+https://…"` · clone + `<$PY> -m pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **Run a generator script** | `uv run <script.py> ARGS` (deps auto via inline metadata) | `<$PY> <script.py> ARGS` |

`<$PY>` = `py` (Windows) / `python3` (macOS/Linux), or the venv python. On PEP-668 Linux add `--break-system-packages` to the pip fallback.

**System binaries — OS package manager** (uv does not manage these):

| Tool(s) | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| git, gh, jq, exiftool, pandoc, poppler/pdfinfo, qpdf, whois | `winget install <Id>` | `brew install <pkg>` | `sudo apt install -y <pkg>` |
| Go toolchain | `winget install GoLang.Go` | `brew install go` | `sudo apt install -y golang` |
| mat2 (metadata strip) | n/a → `exiftool -all= -overwrite_original <file>` | `brew install mat2` | `sudo apt install -y mat2` |
| **agent-browser** (interactive browser) | `npm i -g agent-browser` or `cargo install agent-browser` → `agent-browser install` | `brew install agent-browser` → `agent-browser install` | `npm i -g agent-browser` (or `cargo install`) → `agent-browser install` |

**Go tools** (after Go is present — identical on all OSes): `go install <module>` for subfinder, amass, gau, gitleaks, httpx. PhoneInfoga and TruffleHog → GitHub release binary per OS/arch (`go install` rejects TruffleHog's module for its `replace` directives; the PyPI `trufflehog` is the abandoned v2 Python tool and does not accept v3 syntax). **ASN** → Git Bash/WSL `bash <(curl -sL …/nitefood/asn/master/asn)` on Windows, native bash on macOS/Linux, or RDAP/ipwho.is HTTP fallback.

The exact winget IDs, brew formulae, apt packages, uv commands, import names, and Go module paths for **every** tool are tabulated in [`scripts/platform-setup.md`](scripts/platform-setup.md) §5. To provision a fresh machine in one shot, run the bundled installer for the detected OS:

- **Windows:** `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$SKILL_DIR\scripts\install.ps1"`
- **macOS / Linux / Git Bash / WSL:** `bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/install.sh"`

(both accept `--headless`/`-Headless`, `--go`/`-Go`, `--all`/`-All`)

### Behavior Rules

- **uv first (anything Python):** prefer uv — `uv tool install` for CLIs, `uv pip install` for libraries, `uv run` for scripts. It behaves identically on every OS, so reach for it before per-OS pip/pipx. Fall back to `<$PY> -m pip` / `pipx` only when uv cannot be installed.
- **Detect before install (system binaries):** dispatch by the OS detected in Step 0 — never run `apt` on Windows or `winget` on Linux.
- **Silent install:** do not ask permission — install and proceed. Tool installation is a normal part of the investigation workflow.
- **Go tools:** require Go installed. If `go` is missing, install it via the OS package manager (`winget install GoLang.Go` / `brew install go` / `sudo apt install -y golang`), or note the gap and fall back to the next tool in the cascade.
- **Linux privileges:** system installs need `sudo` unless running as root.
- **Windows specifics:** `winget` may prompt UAC; a freshly installed tool may not be on PATH until the shell is reopened (probe its install dir or restart the shell before declaring failure). The DOCX generator self-heals UTF-8 output and pandoc location — see `platform-setup.md` §6.
- **Git-based install:** for tools without a PyPI package (msftrecon, blackbird, sharetrace), clone the repo and install its `requirements.txt` with `<$PY> -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Fallback on install failure:** if installation fails, log a collection gap and skip to the next tool in the cascade — never block the investigation.
